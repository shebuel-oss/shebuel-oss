<h2>
  Hey there, I'm Shebuel ðŸ‘‹</br>
  </h2>
  <p>An Open Source contributor, Advocate, and Community builder who is super passionate about building healthy and sustainable Open Source communities around projects and their contributors. As an advocate, I speak at Open Source conferences, check out my <a href="https://github.com/shebuel-oss/Talks">talks.</a> <br>
  <br>
As I currently explore how best to contribute value to the Open Source World, I love to share my knowledge with the community as I learn just as the community has helped me grow in my knowledge of Open Source. So you'd see me share a lot on my <a href="https://www.twitter.com/1shebuel">Twitter profile </a>if you follow me. I have a work in progress <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shebuel-inyang">LinkedIn </a> and <a href=https://www.polywork.com/shebuel_oss>Polywork </a>profile</p>



<p>
  I write short helpful articles on<a href="https://shebuel.hashnode.dev/"> hashnode </a>sometimes.
