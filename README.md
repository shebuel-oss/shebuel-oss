<h1>Shebeul - OSS 🥑</h1>
Funny to start with this, I’m a runaway developer & designer :bowtie:, (not a complete runaway though) .</br> 
</br>
I can write some funny looking code still, like my <a href="https://shebuel-oss.github.io/zuri-google-clone-task/">Google Clone</a> :smile: </br>
</br>

I'am an associate product manager on a mission to build world-class products to solve some really interesting problems faced by awesome humans like me. Being in the heart of the game of problem discovery, user research, solution framing, aligning everyone to the goals of the business and all seems like something very interesting :grinning:, but definitely challenging too :unamused:...... but I'm ready for the ride, I love challenges. :muscle: </br>
</br>

Upon deliberate, honest, and careful assessment of my product skills using a trusted tool by experts, I discovered that I scored above average in these skills; **critical thinking, strategic thinking, curiosity, empathy, facilitation, communication, and leadership.** I pride myself on these, interestingly, though still building on them.
</br>
</br>
I believe there’s a whole lot I need to learn, yes a whole lot. I know nothing. 
However, over the years, I have developed through intentional practice, some valuable product skills. 
</br>
